# b-redstone

This is a texture pack for redstoners using Minecraft version 1.15 - 1.21.5. It specifically focuses on improving the redstone components in the game, making them more visually distinct and easier to understand at a glance. It doesn't change any game mechanics or add any new features, but rather enhances the existing ones by providing clearer and more informative textures.
